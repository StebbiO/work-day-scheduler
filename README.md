# Work Day Scheduler

## Goals

The goal of this assignment was to create a workday scheduler that can display the current date, dynamically change the 

class of user input boxes depending on the time, and allow the user to edit and save tasks to local storage. 

Additionally, I added a button for the user to manually reset the tasks on the page and in local storage for use on 

another day. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Moment.js, and Iconic to accomplish this. I also created multiple

branches to work on certain aspects of the project at a time for practice using Git. Below you will find links to the 

repository as well as the deployed application.
